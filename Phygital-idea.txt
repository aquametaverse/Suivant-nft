Phygital NFT
*“Tap your board to rent, race, and get paid — one identity across chains, one balance via Yellow, one source of truth via ENS, with game state on Sui.”*

phygital paddleboard NFT: a 3D‑printed board with an embedded NFC chip that links to an ENS-based identity and uses Yellow for rentals and competition payments. 

Concept in one line
A physical paddleboard “ID card” (3D print + NFC) that represents an on-chain NFT identity (via ENS), and uses Yellow sessions for instant, gasless rentals and competition fees.

How the pieces fit


### 1. Physical board as NFT twin

- Each 3D paddleboard figurine corresponds to one **NFT digital twin**.
- The NFC chip stores a URL or deep-link that resolves to an **ENS name** `subpath like `https://acquametaverse.xyz/scan?ens=aqua123.eth`.
- Scanning the board with a phone:
  - Verifies authenticity by checking the ENS‑linked NFT ownership on-chain.
  - Opens the user’s “paddle ID” page with identities, stats, Sui NFT data, and rental/competition options.

### 2. ENS as the identity + config layer

For each board / rider ENS name (`rider123.eth` or a subname under `aquametaverse.eth`) for free users:

- Text records store:
  - `aqua.sui_object` = Sui object ID for the rider’s NFT.  
  - `aqua.yellow_account` = Yellow session or account identifier.  
  - `aqua.pref_chain` / `aqua.pref_token` = where they want fees settled (e.g., Base + USDC).
- Scanning the NFC:
  - App resolves ENS, fetches text records, and knows exactly which Sui object to read and which Yellow session/account to open.

This shows ENS as more than name→address; it’s routing identity and payment preferences, which matches the ENS DeFi prize framing.

### 3. Yellow for rentals and competitions

Yellow gives you **state channels** for high-frequency, off-chain activity with one on-chain settle:


- **Rentals**:
  - Tap the paddleboard → app verifies NFT/ENS → user starts a **Yellow session**.  
  - Every minute of rental or each usage event increments an off-chain tab.  
  - At the end, Yellow settles once on-chain in the renter’s chosen chain/token (from ENS prefs)


- **Competitions**:
  - Before a race, riders tap their boards to join a lobby.  
  - Each rider locks a wager or entry fee into a Yellow session.  
  - Race results update balances off-chain.  
  - At the end, Yellow settles payouts to winners, again on the preferred chain.

This defines App requirements: **off‑chain transaction logic**, session-based spending, and improved UX (no gas per micro-event).

### 

- **Sui**: holds the dynamic game/identity NFTs and statistics; Sui is already highlighted as growing in gaming/DeFi.
- **ENS**: powers identity, config, and payment preferences via text records, and links the physical paddleboard to its on-chain twin.
- **Yellow**: handles rentals and competition flows as Web2‑smooth, off-chain sessions with secure on-chain settlement.
